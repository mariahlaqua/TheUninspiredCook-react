# About The Uninspired Cook React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### What 

The Uninspired Cook gets a random recipe from [The Meal Database API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and renders it. This app was previously made with vanilla JS, html and CSS. The repository for that version is [here](https://github.com/mariahlaqua/TheUninspiredCook).

These projects serve as a basis of comparison for individuals learning React after learning basic DOM manipulation with JS.

### WIP

This is obviously a work in progress. Here's completed and upcoming work:
- [X] Move JSON parsing to API.js (actually moved to context folder and became context provider, renamed meal.js)
- [X] Fix rendering of measurements and ingredients
- [X] Trigger get request on loading of page (useEffect)
- [ ] Create a diagram that compares two applications
- [ ] remove extra packages
- [X] styling with Tailwind CSS (in progress)
